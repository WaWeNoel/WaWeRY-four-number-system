# New coverter! - v3.1.1
### Online converter
* https://waweryto.weebly.com/
## Using
### Text to WaWeRY:
* Only use just one character to convert
(*this is a stupid error, because the code in the other file, in which you can use more characters, cannot distinguish between lower and upper case letters*)
### WaWeRY to text:
* You can write several numbers here, but there must be a space after each number

## Other bugs
* You can't convert **"** in text to wavery only if you type scrawl
* You can't convert \ in text to wavery only if you type backslash

**Wait for the next relase to solve the problem ;)**
